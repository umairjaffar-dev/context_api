/** Arrays ____ Big-O
 * Adding or Removeing elements from end of an array(Push or Pop), it will take O(1) time, means time complaxcity is constant.
 * Adding or Removing element from beginning an array(Shift | Unshift | Splice | concat | slice), it will take O(n) time, means time complaxcity is linear.
 * (forEach | map | filter | reduce) will take O(n) time, means time complaxcity is linear.
 * Accessing element from an array will take O(1) time, means time complaxcity is also constant.
 * Search element from an array will take O(n) time, means time complaxcity is linear.
